# Machine Learning on Clothing Dataset
**Complete ANALYSIS REPORT is also provided**
For this project, we will be applying machine learning models (both regression and classification) to a dataset containing information about various individuals, their clothing, and its properties along with other atmospheric elements such as temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. The users also provided feedback on if they feel cold or not. The feedback (through AMV and PMV) is based on the following mapping:

The dataset is given in an Excel file named `CollectedData.xlsx`, see sheet 2 of the Excel file. The dimension names (column headers) are not mentioned in the given file. The table below describes the columns which will be of your interest.
